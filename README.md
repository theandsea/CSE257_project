# Neural Network
neural network of LeNet-5 architecture on MNIST </p>
I establish the neural network according this paper Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition__lecun-98 YANN LECUN, MEMBER, IEEE, LEON BOTTOU, YOSHUA BENGIO, Â´ AND PATRICK HAFFNER and reproduced LeNet-5 architecture. </p>
to use the MNIST data, we need to unzip 4 files in MNIST.rar to the root directory first before running the program.</p>
run neuralnetwork.java to run LeNet-5 architecture to train and recognize MNIST data. </p>
